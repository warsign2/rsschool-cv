    <li>About me:</li>
    <p>The main goal of this training, I think for myself, is to open new horizons and gain knowledge in the field of IT. The priority in the direction I have chosen is to study the basics of the JavaScript programming language. There is no experience in IT, because the previous type of activity was radically different from what is taught in these courses.
        There is no work experience in the IT field, because the previous work was related to the oil industry.</p>
